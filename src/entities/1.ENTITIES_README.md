# Entities

This is where all the Models for database and graphql will be placed. It uses type-graphql & typegoose to handle the types without code duplication

Entities are a combination of GraphQl object types and Mongoose Models definition

All Models(e.g.: `UserModel`) should be placed in `src/entities/index.ts` to avoid [circular dependency problem](https://typegoose.github.io/typegoose/docs/guides/advanced/reference-other-classes/#circular-dependencies])
